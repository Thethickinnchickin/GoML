## üìã Overview

**SecureGo Login System** is a robust and efficient authentication solution developed using Go (Golang). This project demonstrates how to build a secure, scalable, and user-friendly login system that protects user credentials from unauthorized access. It showcases advanced techniques such as JWT-based authentication, password hashing with bcrypt, role-based access control (RBAC), and audit logging.

---

## üö© Problem Statement

In an age of pervasive digital interactions, user credentials are under constant threat. Traditional login mechanisms often fail to adapt to modern security requirements, leaving accounts vulnerable. SecureGo tackles these challenges by providing:

* Strong encryption and hashing to safeguard passwords.
* JWT token-based session handling.
* RBAC to control access to sensitive routes.
* Audit trails to monitor and respond to suspicious activity.

---

## üéØ Goals

‚úÖ **Enhanced Security:** Leverages Go's capabilities to implement secure authentication and encryption techniques.
‚úÖ **User-Friendly Experience:** Balances security with a seamless login and registration flow.
‚úÖ **Scalable & Performant:** Built to handle growth without sacrificing performance.
‚úÖ **Adaptable & Integratable:** Easily integrates into diverse tech stacks.
‚úÖ **Auditable:** Includes logging and monitoring for accountability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Technologies

* **Go (Golang):** High-performance backend language.
* **MySQL:** Database for persistent user and role storage.
* **bcrypt:** For secure password hashing.
* **JWT:** Stateless authentication tokens.
* **Gorilla Mux:** HTTP router.
* **CORS & Middleware:** For secure HTTP access control.

## üìù Project Structure & Components

### Core Files

* **`main.go`** ‚Äî Entry point. Initializes MySQL, configures routes, middleware, and starts the server.

---

### Database Layer

* **`db/database.go`** ‚Äî Initializes and connects to MySQL database.
* **`models/user.go`** ‚Äî Defines the `User` struct with username, hashed password, and role.
* **`repositories/user_repository.go`** ‚Äî Provides CRUD operations for user data.

---

### Handlers

* **`handlers/homeHandler.go`** ‚Äî Serves the home route (`/`), confirming server status.
* **`handlers/loginHandler.go` & `handlers/adminLoginHandler.go`** ‚Äî Authenticate users and admins. Generate JWT tokens with claims.
* **`handlers/registerHandler.go`** ‚Äî Registers new users, hashes their passwords, and issues a JWT token.

---

### Helpers

* **`helpers/passwordHelper.go`** ‚Äî Checks hashed vs. plain-text passwords.
* **`helpers/tokenHelper.go`** ‚Äî Creates, validates, and extracts JWT tokens from requests.

---

### Middleware

* **`middleware/authmiddleware.go`** ‚Äî Ensures routes are only accessible to authenticated users.
* **`middleware/rbacmiddleware.go`** ‚Äî Restricts routes to specific user roles.

---

## üîÑ Features

‚ú® **JWT Authentication:** Stateless and secure user sessions.
‚ú® **Password Hashing:** bcrypt used to protect stored passwords.
‚ú® **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Grants different access levels to admin and regular users.
‚ú® **CORS Handling:** Safe cross-origin resource sharing.
‚ú® **Audit Trails:** Logs all login attempts and access for monitoring.

## üöÄ How to Run

### Prerequisites

* Go (>=1.18)
* MySQL

### Steps

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd securego-login-system
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure your MySQL connection in `db/database.go`.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the server:

```bash
go run main.go
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ The server runs on `http://localhost:8080`.
